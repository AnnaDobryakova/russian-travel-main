            <h2 class="intro__title">What didn't we see there?</h2>
            <p class="intro__text">According to VCIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their vacation in their own country. 
                Why haven't we seen what's here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, dense forests of the Sayan Mountains, 
                and severe ice of the Putorana Plateau. Moreover, you can see all these beauties without millions in your account, a passport, and long flights. 
                For example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother, took her three children, put them in her "Lada," and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her homeland. 
                We have selected and described some interesting places worth your vacation.</p>

                    <p class="place__paragraph">The Kaliningrad region does not end there. For the traveler and explorer, there is also the westernmost point of Russia, the Baltic Spit, and the German heritage of a scattering of small seaside towns. The atmosphere of these places eliminates the fuss, dipping into the tranquility of nature and the smell of steel, cool sea.</p>

Perhaps you were not interested in the ultra-deep well penetrating the earth's crust, and apatites have long covered you with apathy. But your dream of seeing the northern lights begins to come true with a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

                    <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes covered with pines, mountain rivers, and lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places — mountain air.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is moderate, so it's best to go here in summer. This way, you will see all the diversity of the local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, that's all true. But Baikal is also an ideal place for skijoring competitions. This is a sport where a skier ties themselves to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record was set at the Baikal Mile festival — 197.011 km/h.</p>

                    <p class="place__paragraph">Siberia does not end in the Urals, but in Karelia: the Siberian larch that forms the taiga does not grow west of Vodlozero. But here it swings up to 30 meters — the forests of Karelian national parks, due to impenetrable swamps, have never known an ax. Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living being that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In the virgin forest, you will not find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on rare paths, trees a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.</p>
